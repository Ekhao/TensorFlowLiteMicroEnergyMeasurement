This repository contains a changed version of the TensorFlow Lite Micro "Hello World" example.
It has been stripped of unnecessary code for measuring the energy consumption of a device running the code - this, e.g., includes removing input and output handling for the machine learning model.
A 10-second delay has also been added to identify breaks between inference runs and let MBEDos handle operating system tasks during this time.
To make the timing of model inference easier, the neural network model has been replaced with the neural network model from the "Person Detector" example.
Timers have been added to allow for simulating/calculating the energy consumption of the program using datasheet values for power consumption during work and low power modes.
